# Dot

Dot is a framework for managing large numbers of applications and their
configurations via shell scripts.

It allows you to:

* Organize your dotfile configurations in any manner you choose

* Maintain dotfile configurations for different shells simultaneously
  (useful if you frequently log in to multiple systems with different
  available shells)

* Specify how your configurations should be installed (where symlinks should
  point to, which repositories to clone, which Homebrew formula to install,
  etc.), making it easy to get set up on a new machine, and also making it easy
  to remove your presence from that machine when you're done

## Installation

The initial step depends on whether you're installing on a brand new machine
(i.e. core programs like `git` or `gcc` have not been installed on it yet)
or are installing Dot on typical machine with stuff already on it.

### Typical Install

    git clone git://github.com/sds/dot.git ~/.dotfiles

### Blank Slate

    mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles && \
      curl -L https://github.com/sds/dot/tarball/master | \
      tar xz --strip 1 -C ~/.dotfiles

Once you have Dot on your system using one of the above methods, run the install
script:

    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install

Reload your terminal and you're all set. Don't worry, Dot will backup any dot
files it replaces. You can uninstall Dot and revert to your previous setup at
any time by running the `uninstall` script within the Dot directory.

    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./uninstall

## Organization

Dot allows you to organize configuration settings into logical groups. The
`plugins` directory contains a folder for each one of these groups (e.g. an
`ssh` folder for SSH-related settings, or a `git` folder for git-related
settings).

Each of these directories can contains files of the form
`plugin.{sh,bash,zsh}`. `plugin` files are loaded on shell startup, and perform
any environment initialization (e.g. exporting variables) to support the
particular plugin.

For any file that is loaded from a plugin, the `.sh` extension is loaded
first. `.sh` files are intended to represent code that runs regardless of
which shell you are using (i.e. it should contain shell-agnostic code).

Next, any file with the shell-specific extension of the current shell (e.g.
`.bash` or `.zsh`) is loaded to run commands specific to that shell. This
allows you to tweak your configuration on a per-shell basis.

In each plugin, there may also be an installation script `setup.sh`, and
other configuration files related to the plugin. For example, a plugin
directory for git would likely have `gitconfig` and `gitignore` files, along
with an `setup.sh` script which symlinks these files to the user's home
directory.

Look at the `plugins` directory for examples of how this organizational system
works in practice.

## Writing a Plugin

Writing your own plugin with Dot is designed to be easy. To start, you need
to identify what you want your plugin to do.

  * Does it install files in your home directory?
  * Does it set any environment variables?
  * Does it declare any aliases or functions for use in your shell?

If you're installing any sort of files or repository, you'll need to add a
`setup.sh` script to your plugin, and in that either have a `setup` function
which makes the appropriate calls to `symlink`, `file`, `repo`, etc., or
individual `install`/`uninstall` functions to carry out the install/uninstall
commands by hand.

### Install/Uninstall Scripts

Defining a function called `setup` in a plugin's `setup.sh` allows you to use
a "declarative" syntax for specifying which files and repos your plugin
requires. Using this declarative syntax means you only have to write your setup
script once---there's no need to define what to do when you install a script
versus when you uninstall (i.e. instead of creating a symlink in the install
script and removing the symlink in the uninstall script, you just declare the
existence of the directory once).

Here's an example of a `setup.sh` file for installing some symlinks for `git`:

    setup () {
      symlink "$HOME/.gitconfig" "$DOTPLUGIN/gitconfig"
      symlink "$HOME/.gitignore" "$DOTPLUGIN/gitignore"
    }

Here we use the `symlink` helper to declare that the `.gitconfig`/`.gitignore`
files in the user's home directory should be symlinks pointing to the
`gitconfig` and `gitignore` files in the plugin directory itself. When
installing, `symlink` makes a backup of any currently existing
`.gitconfig`/`.gitignore` files if they exist, and replaces them with symlinks.
When uninstalling, these symlinks are removed, and if backups were made they
are restored.

If the install/uninstall processes vary significantly, you can also explictly
define them by defining `install` and `uninstall` functions in your plugin's
`setup.sh`. For example:

    install () {
      mkdir "$HOME/blah"
    }

    uninstall () {
      rm -rf "$HOME/blah"
    }

### Implementing your Plugin

If you're setting environment variables, aliases, or defining custom functions,
these should go in the `plugin.sh` file. How you organize this file is entirely
up to you; you can source other files in order to impose your own source code
structure.

Here's an example of a `plugin.sh` for `tmux`, which overrides the `tmux`
command with custom behaviour, and also adds an alias.

    alias t=tmux

    # Automatically name sessions to the directory from which we started tmux
    tmux () {
      if [ -z "$@" ]; then
        local dir=`basename $(pwd)`
        # Attach to session with the current directory name if one exists,
        # otherwise automatically create a session with the current directory name
        command tmux attach-session -t "$dir" || command tmux new-session -s "$dir"
      else
        command tmux "$@"
      fi
    }

Note that `plugin.sh` is run regardless of which shell you are using. If you
have a plugin specific to a particular shell, such as `zsh`, then you'll have
to create a `plugin.zsh` file instead. However, you should try to make your
plugins as general as possible.

#### Helper Environment Variables

The following environment variables are useful when writing plugins:

* `DOTDIR`: Location of the Dot repository. If you installed using the
  instructions above, this would be `$HOME/.dotfiles`, with `$HOME`
  appropriately expanded

* `DOTPLUGIN`: Location of the plugin running the currently plugin code.
  This is available only within the context of a plugin (e.g. in the
  `plugin.sh` and `setup.sh` files of a plugin)

* `DOTLOGDIR`: Directory to store log files (optional to use, but useful
  if you like keeping all logs in one place). Shortcut for `"$DOTDIR/log"`

* `DOTTMPDIR`: Directory to store temporary files (optional to use). Shortcut
  for `"$DOTDIR/tmp"`

## Motivations

Dot was motivated by the desire to:

* Save setup time on new systems

* Provide a flexible framework for organizing a large number of dotfile
  configurations

* Provide a way to gracefully degrade from `zsh` to `bash` in the event
  `zsh` wasn't available (likely when using dotfiles on multiple systems)

* Allow easy switching between shells when pair programming (for example
  if one pair prefers `bash`)

* Learn more about the idiosyncrasies of `bash` and `zsh`

While it currently only supports `bash` and `zsh`, in theory there's nothing
preventing it from supporting `csh` or others---there's just little
motivation to do so as they are far less commonly used.

## Etymology

Dot comes from the fact that it ultimately manages 'dot' files, and is a
tribute to [Dot Matrix][DotMatrix] of [ReBoot][ReBoot] fame.
